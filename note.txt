- ADON bit 
- delay x ms
- clock APB2 max 72 MHz , clock not exceed 14MHz
- the regular group compose 16 sequence
- inject group compose 4 sequences
- temp sensor is in ADC1_in16
- VREF is in ADC1_IN17
- Single mode: read more
- Countinous conversion mode:
--- In ADC->CR2: set CONT bit, ADON bit.
--- 16-bit ADC_DR register
--- After the start of ADC conversion and after 14 clock cycles, the EOC
flag is set and the 16-bit ADC Data register contains the result of the conversion.
--- EOC reset by software
-- Analog watchdog
