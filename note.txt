1. The independent watchdog (IWDG) is clocked by its own dedicated low-speed clock (LSI)
and thus stays active even if the main clock fails
2. writing the value 0xCCCC in the Key register
(IWDG_KR) to start IWDG, the counter starts counting down from the reset value of 0xFFF. When it
reaches the end of count value (0x000) a reset signal is generated (IWDG reset)
3. key value 0xAAAA is written in the IWDG_KR register, the IWDG_RLR value
is reloaded in the counter and the watchdog reset is prevented.
